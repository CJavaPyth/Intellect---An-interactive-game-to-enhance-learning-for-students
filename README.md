CZ3003 - Intellect---An-interactive-game-to-enhance-learning-for-students


This project consists of the Intellect Game Application for the Students and a Web App for the
Teachers.

The game application is meant for Students and aims to revive the learning interests of Students by
providing a fun and interactive learning platform that they can use outside the classroom. Features
such as performance tracking, experience level and total points scored shall prove to be imperative
in their improvement.

The web application is to be used by Teachers/instructors to track performance of Students. They
can manage and supervise the learning of their Students by giving them assignments/quizzes. It
provides an efficient analytical tool that allows Teachers to understand the Studentsâ€™ game progress
and assess their overall mastery of the course. This information can be used for adjusting teaching
content and key points during classroom teaching. Lastly, it allows the Teachers to make changes to
the game application if any modification of the game content is necessary.
